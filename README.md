## Getting started

`npm install` - get all package dependencies

### Development

`npm run dev` - starts dev server that watches for changes in js code and restarts automatically

\*Note: need to restart server manually if you change `schema.yaml`

### Deployment

Ensure this command runs when your server starts on your host:

`npm start`
